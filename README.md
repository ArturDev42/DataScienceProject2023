## Abstract
Recently, Large Language Models have found wide
applications in many language generation tasks and therefore
gathered a lot of interest. However, the field of opinion-based
question generation did not receive much attention and therefore, neither specifically developed opinion question generation
systems nor metrics for their evaluation exist. To address the lack
thereof, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large language models for
both tasks. In this paper, we find Flan-T5 to be an adequate model
for English opinion question generation while observing strong
limitations for the use of German. We identify problems with
pre-existing natural language generation metrics, especially for
the assessment of opinion questions, and contextualize the limited
extend to which they can be used. We develop new pre-trained
metrics to predict various aspects of a textâ€™s quality. This work
provides initial findings for opinion question generation, metrics
to evaluate them and how to further opinion question generation
and evaluation.
